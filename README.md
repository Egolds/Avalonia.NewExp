# Avalonia MVVM Starter Project

A basic project template for starting almost any Avalonia UI project with MVVM ViewModel-First implementation and Dependency Injection.

## Features

- **NavigationService**: Navigation based on ViewModel.
- **ViewModelLocator**: Simplified access to ViewModel instances from the DI container.
- **WindowManager**: Allows opening windows by passing a ViewModel to the `Show`/`ShowDialog` methods.
- **Example of Avalonia AttachedProperty usage** (WindowBehaviors): Demonstrated in the `MainWindow`.

## Getting Started

This project provides a foundational structure for Avalonia-based applications and can be easily extended based on your specific requirements.
